<p>
The original game <em>Block Run</em>, was created as a simple platform game in Python (using pyGame). It was the first <em>"real"</em> game that I've created, because of this things were not done in the most effiecent way. Now I'm doing a new and improved <em>Block Run</em> written in JavaScript using the HTML5 Canvas.
