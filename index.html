                  <h4>About Me</h4>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    I started doing development work in the early 2000s back in elementary school making and games with ActionScript and GameMaker along with art and running, back then I knew I wanted to be a software developer. To me software development is an artform where you can create whatever you want but instead of a brush you use logic, it's something you can interact with instead of just something to look at.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In highschool I focused more on web and application development, with a focus on full stack development. I also worked on personal projects and answered questions on Yahoo Answers and later StackOverflow. Then started working as a web developer with IUPUI a bit before I started my freshman year in college; in my later college years I worked as a TA and a software developer for DataXStream. Here I grew an interest with AI with a focus on machine learning and took every AI course both grad and undergraduate. 
                  </p>

                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Lately I've been on the work grind, I've not done as many personal projects over the years that I've wanted to, so I'm focusing on doing more of those and showcasing them here. I've been actively working on <a href="Block%20Run/blockRun.html">Block Run</a> and cleaning up <a href="GoldMine/goldMine.html">Gold Mine</a> (<em>Fun game but was a rushed school project</em>). Once Block Run v1.0 comes out I'll be working on a fun new project and looking into 3D Javascript games! There is also a game concept I've had for awhile that I'm considering making into a Professional game with either Monogame or Unity. Along with that I'll be working on this website and getting back into art and animation and will be uploading that to the Art page.

                        <p>C# is one of my most commonly used languages in my carrer. With Dataxstream the XstreamConnector upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 was built in C# .NET. When I worked with Navient we used ASP.NET Webforms and WPF and where in the proccess of transitioning over to Razor for the CARES Application. In my current job the Vault Service is built in C# .Net Framework 4. I've used C# consistently throughout my carrer since I was an intern in college. Below are some notable work projects using C#:</p>

                        <p>I've been working in Javascript actively for a long time both in my carrer and for fun, it's my goto language because it's so easy to share what you made with others. All my web HTML5 games are Javascript based and for work I've worked on a varity of websites and react apps. Below are a few of the projects I've worked on in JavaScript:</p>
                        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">

                    <p>February is here after a cold January, the focus for this month will be working on Block Run. I've made alot of proccess and we are already at 0.9. The home strech will be the second and final boss. Once this is done I'm going to start focusing on ThreeJS Zombie Shoot.</p>
                    <p>There are some other future plans that include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Game Engine learnings including: Monogame, Unity, and Unreal. I do like making games from scatch but I do want to get comfortable with some engines.</li>
                      <li>AI Research and Project Start: I'll be starting on something I wanted to for quite awhile now. Basically a way to train on a small subset of document images and extract those fields automatically.</li>
                      <li>Work starting on the development planning of Town RPG.</li>
